/*
The for loop has the following syntax:

for (initializer; condition; iterator)
{
    //code block 
}
C#
The initializer runs once when we enter the loop, and initializes the variable.

The second part is the condition that specifies when to stop the loop.

The third part, the iterator, runs every time the loop runs. It is usually used to increment the variable used in the condition.

ðŸ’¡loops allow you to run the same code multiple times

ðŸ’¡the for loop has 3 components: the initializer, the condition, and the iterator

ðŸ’¡here is a default structure of a for loop:

for (initializer; condition; iterator)
{
    //code block 
}
