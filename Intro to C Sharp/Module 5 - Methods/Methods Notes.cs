/*
ðŸ’¡methods are reusable, we define them once and can call them multiple times

ðŸ’¡the static keyword is used in the definition of a method, so we can call them in Main.

ðŸ’¡The void keyword means that the method does not return a value.

ðŸ’¡In C#, it is good practice to start with an uppercase letter when naming methods

ðŸ’¡To call a method, use its name followed by parentheses.

We will learn about return values in the next lessons, so stay tuned!
