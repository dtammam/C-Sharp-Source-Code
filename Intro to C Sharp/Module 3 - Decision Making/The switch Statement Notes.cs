ğŸ’¡the switch statement tests a variable for equality against a list of values, and performs actions if there is a match

ğŸ’¡there are cases when the switch statement can replace multiple if else statements, and that makes the code more readable

ğŸ’¡the break statement is obligatory for each case

ğŸ’¡the default keyword is used to perform an action when there is no match
