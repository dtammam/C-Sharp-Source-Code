/*
ğŸ’¡variables are containers for storing values

ğŸ’¡every variable has a type, which defines the type of the value it holds, for example, string

ğŸ’¡to create a variable you need to use its type and give that variable a name, for example, string country;

ğŸ’¡you can assign a variable a value with the equal sign =, for example, string country = "Spain";

ğŸ’¡variables can change their value throughout the program

ğŸ’¡remember to keep the rules of naming variables
